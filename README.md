# NVIM CONFIG

**THIS IS A BACKUP OF MY NEOVIM CONFIG**

Currently refactoring my neovim config to use the new and upcoming builtin
package manager.

---

## CURRENT CONFIG

1. Uses lazy.vim as the packages manager

---

## TODO

- [ ] remove unneeded plugins
    - can reflect refactored config
- [ ] change harpoon so it doesn't use telescope
